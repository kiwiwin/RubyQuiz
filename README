There are many good practice problem at website http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz14.html

Because there are about hundreds of problems, So I will not create separate project for each problem.

For each problem, there will be one src package whose name is the problem name and the problem index.

And there are also test package associate with each problem.

You can also find the problem statement in each package.


Have fun of refactoring!!!
